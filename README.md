# AGH - Graphs and Their Uses
Tasks for "Graphs and Their Uses" course at AGH UST.

The project was developed and tested in Python 3.8 in Windows system.

Each project is shortly described in the list below. 
Details about each class, method and functionality such as arguments or certain requirements are described in the appropriate file as docstrings.

# PROJECT 1
To run solutions of tasks from project it's enough to run the Project_01.py file.
The solutions use: 
1. Graph.py - represent simple graphs.
    * reading graph data from file and printing it;
    * drawing a graph.
2. GraphManager.py - allow to perform some operations connected with simple graphs.
    * constructing random graphs using Erdos-Renyi model and Gilbert model.
3. representation_checks.py - check correctness of graph representation.
    * checking whether passed graph data, that is adjacency matrix, incidence matrix or adjacency list, is correct.
4. representation_conversions.py - convert graph representation from one to the other.
    * checking graph representation and converting it to the other.
