# AGH - Graphs and Their Uses
Tasks for "Graphs and Their Uses" course at AGH UST.
The project requires Python in version 3.8 or higher.

# PROJECT 1
To run solutions of tasks from project it's enough to run the Project_01.py file.
The solutions use: 
1. Graph.py file to represent graphs using some sort of graph manager (reading graph from file, drawing graph, making random graph etc.).
2. representation_checks.py to check correctness of graph representation.
3. representation_conversions.py to convert graph representation from one to the other.
